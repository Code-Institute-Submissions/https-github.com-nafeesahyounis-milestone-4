## Goals

### Visitor Goals

The target audience for lifestyle redesigned is adults looking for a one-stop ecommerce site where they can have their lifestyle service related needs met. Lifestyle redesigned acts as a connecting point for consumers and professionals in one of the main categories. Consumers can use the site to book their consultations and access a database of a variety of different professionals to choose from.

The user goals are:

- To have a database where they can quickly and easily find professionals in one of the four service fields: home design, personal styling, fitness & life coaching.

- To be able to easily purchase their first consultation without having to search through lots of different websites.

- To contribute to a growing lifestyle service industry.

Lifestyle redesigned is a great way to address these needs because:

- Currently it is very difficult to find a collection of lifestyle services. Usually the professional has just their own website and you have to contact them personally to book.

- The design of the site is very simple and functional, so it's easy to find what you need and purchase your first consultation.

- At the moment the site is very simple, but later there will be additional features such as a calendar.

### Business Goals

The target businesses for this site are consultants in the four areas of personal trainers, interior designers, stylists and life coaches. This will act as a platform for them to advertise themselves and their business and book more clients.

### Business User Goals

Business user goals are:

- A functional, clean and appealing-to-the eye site upon which I can advertise my business.

- For the end user to easily be able to find my listings through searching via the category.

- For the end user to have a clear overview of what we offer and our pricing.

Lifestyle Redesigned currently caters towards this in the following ways:

- The site has a simple and intuitive colour scheme and design, so it is easy to navigate and find what the user is looking for.

- There is a carousel and a call of action on the homepage, which immediately tells the user what services are available.

- Businesses are able to display all their information on the 'listings page' so that the user can have a better idea of their services.

- There is also a sort filter so the pricing of businesses is clear from the get-go.

### Lifestyle Redesigned Goals

- To provide a clean, clear site where the end user can access lifestyle services in one place.

- To provide a platform for businesses and freelancers to advertise their services.

- As a developer, this was my first time working with Django. My goal was to get familiar enough with the language to build a payment system and various smaller apps and combine them with Front-end.

- Although this is a student project, in the future I would like to expand on the functionality so that there is a separate login system and set of features for businesses to go in and perform CRUD applications so that it can be used as an advertising platform.
